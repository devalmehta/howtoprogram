# howtoprogram

This is a maven project. Gives you basic idea of how to approach certain problems. Please check out and make necessary changes. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Program names are self explainotary. 
2. All are main classes so there are no tests written. 
3. I add more to this as and when I get time.
4. Please note that programs may not consider 100% corner case scenarios. They are left for individuals to decide to test.
